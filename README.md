I made a SQL database with procedures for recommending books based on collaborative filtering. The database is in BCNF, and it includes views for presenting summarized information regarding authors, book themes, and customers -to name a few- as well as triggers for preventing any obvious user errors and other procedures for offering more specialised views of the data by asking for query parameters.
